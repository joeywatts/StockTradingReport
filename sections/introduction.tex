\section{Introduction}

There have been numerous instances in the past where tweets have been used to create short term trading positions on specific stocks.
On September 23, 2016, a tweet reported speculation on a possible takeover of Twitter by Google.
The tweet was sent at around 9 AM, and, by 11 AM, the Twitter stock had gained about 20\% on its previous day closing price \cite{twitterTakeover}.
We want to build a bot that can analyze a given set of people who tweet about stock trading.
By analyzing their historical predictions and matching them with current data, we would filter the junk analysts and only follow the ones who have good accuracy in their predictions.
For those tweeters, we would follow the tweets in real-time and employ sophisticated machine learning algorithms in text classification to analyze stock sentiments.
Based on this analysis, we will develop, test, and compare multiple trading strategies.
We would want to test the strategies with historical data from multiple intervals to determine how the strategies perform in different market climates.
With analysis of these tests, we will determine particular strengths and weaknesses of particular strategies and which strategies perform the best.
